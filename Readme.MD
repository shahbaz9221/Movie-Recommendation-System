## Requirements

To use the Movie Recommendation System, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- Pandas
- NumPy

## Getting Started

1. **Download the Movie Dataset**: Obtain a dataset containing the following CSV files:
   - `movies.dat`: Movie data with columns MovieId, Title, and Genre.
   - `users.dat`: User data.
   - `ratings.dat`: Ratings data with columns UserId, MovieId, Rating, and Timestamp.

2. **Dataset Structure**: Ensure that the CSV files are organized within a directory named "Movie_Dataset." This directory should be located in the same directory as the script.

3. **Running the Script**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py

## Usage

Upon running the script, you will be presented with the following options:

### Item-Based Recommendation System

This system recommends movies similar to a selected movie.

1. Enter `1` when prompted to select this option.
2. You will be asked to enter the title of the movie for which you want recommendations.

### User-Based Recommendation System

This system recommends users who are similar to a selected user.

1. Enter `2` when prompted to select this option.
2. You will be asked to enter the user ID for which you want to find similar users.

### Exit
